Here is a short FAQ about this repository

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are discussing about visualization capabilities of ggplot2 in R. You will learn to create some popular plots and customize them using the ggplot2 in R. It includes the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and a readme.

**2) What is ggplot2?**

ggplot2 in R is the latest version of the famous open-source data visualization tool ggplot for the statistical programming language R. The term ggplot2 relates to the packageâ€™s name. We use the function ggplot() to produce the plots when using the package. Therefore, ggplot() is the command, and the whole package is called ggplot2. It is a part of the R tidyverse, an ecosystem of packages designed with common APIs.

Details of the ggplot2 library setup and plots are discussed in my article published on AnalyticsVidhya
